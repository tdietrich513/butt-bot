# Butt Bot
Discord chatbot that sometimes responds to people talking in a channel with a cheeky joke. 

## Adding the bot to your server
If you're running a discord server, you should be able to add the bot by going [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=742779005148856392&scope=bot&permissions=68672). 

## Notes:
The bot randomly triggers, to avoid spamming a channel the odds of triggering are lowered to zero and slowly increase over the course of 30 minutes or so. 

The bot also appreciates it when people react to it's jokes and talk about butts in general.

You can force a joke with `!!butt <message to target>` or `!!dadjoke`
